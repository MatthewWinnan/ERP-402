# ERP-402
AODV.drawio.pdf shows the main route recovery phase for pure AODV. The RRER is excluded as it is rather self explanitory and has no
real difficult overhead.

Added a proof of concept sketch that I will use to explain the AOMDV algorithm. I am planning on easing on
 the node independency aspect an focus more on link independency as this will help with smarter link repairs,
 path selection and hopefully won't impact load balancing as much.
